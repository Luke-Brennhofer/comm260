<ul>
	<li> People can learn about different takes on fashion </li>
	<li> People can gain confidence while getting their name out to the world </li>
	<li> Educate those on the past and future of fashion </li>
	<li> We can ignite a new passion for those who are new to the world of fashion </li>
</ul>
