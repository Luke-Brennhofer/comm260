        <h2>First post</h2>
        <p> Wowie this is my first post.  Crazy to think anyone will just read my blog and read about what's going on in my life.
        </p>
        <h3>Posted on some date in some year</h3>
        <p id="date"> 9/18/2021 </p>
        <p>I worked my <em> first shift </em> at the thrift store.  I have worked at a movie theater back home for about three and a half years, but I need a job at school.  It is kind of nervewracking because the jobs are not the same, but I am excited to jump in and learn.  I love thrift stores, there's so many cool things just waiting to be found there.

        <p>Today I worked on my homework.  Working the weekend took up a lot of time and mental energy so catching up on homework has been tough.  I had 2 exams this weekend, <strong> absolutely crazy.</strong>  I forgot how hard taking exams was.  Every little inconvience has felt <em> 10 times</em> worse, but I am powering through and getting what needs to be done done. 
        <h3>Something excited happened.</h3>
        <p>  It seems silly to get excited over food, but getting Taco Bell sounds really good.  I plan on getting Taco Bell for lunch as a reward for getting all my homework done and staying organized this weekend.  I made a mini checklist for what I planned on getting done and it feels really good to check off everything.
