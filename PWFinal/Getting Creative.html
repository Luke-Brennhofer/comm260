    We want to help anyone who wants to learn more about fashion and be expressive.  Using croquis to sketch out outfits is a helpful way for us to get our ideas across.
</p>
<p>
    Another way we like to get our creative juices flowing is explore new desingers.  Watching fashion shows online helps us expand our fashion view and see new outfits and learn about new designers.  We enjoy watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FatalefashionIII"> Fatale Fashion </a>

    Here's what we like to do to sketch out our outfits,
    <ol>
        <li>We first find a blank croqui image from google.</li>
        <li>We enjoy using Pinterest to find inspiration.</li>
        <li>Once we have our ideas and plan, we get sketching.</li>
    </ol>

    Fashion is all around us.  Sometimes observing what other people are wearing is a good way to see what's popular.  Make sure not to seem creepy by staring at people, but take a second to get a glimpse at someone's outfit.

    Thrift stores can have some hidden gems.  It's always fun to go thrifting and check what they may have.  Sometimes you can find your new favorite jacket or a vintage garment.  Regardless of your intention while going thrifting, we think it's a great way to improve your closet and style.  Just make sure to wash your clothing after you buy it.
<br> Some thrift stores that are good to visit are,
    <ol>
        <li>Goodwill</li>
        <li>Savers</li>
        <li>Salvation Army</li>
    </ol>
    There may be some thrift stores that are local to your area, so give them a try as well.
