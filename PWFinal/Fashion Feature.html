            Ben was April's Fashion Feature.  His outfit follows suit with last month Kinely's style, looking for comfort while on the go.  Layering a jacket on top of his tan shirt adds dimmension to the outfit.  Wearing some rolled up black jeans brings the outfit together to go with a simple, yet effective color pallete.  He finished his look with some accessorizing, some braclets and a necklace.
